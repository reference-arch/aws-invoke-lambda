# Data Pipeline InvokeLambda Sample

## Overview

This sample shows how to build a Shell Command Activity pipeline that invokes AWS Lambda function. 

## Prerequisites

You must have the AWS CLI and default IAM roles setup in order to run the sample. Please see the [readme](https://github.com/awslabs/data-pipeline-samples) for the base repository for instructions how to do this.

## Run this sample pipeline using the AWS CLI

```sh 
  $> aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name invoke_lambda_pipeline --unique-id invoke_lambda_pipeline
```

You receive a pipelineId like this. 
```sh
  #   -----------------------------------------
  #   |             CreatePipeline             |
  #   +-------------+--------------------------+
  #   |  pipelineId |  <Your Pipeline ID>      |
  #   +-------------+--------------------------+
```

```sh
  $> aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-definition file://invokelambda.json --parameter-values myLambdaFunction=<your lambda function>  myS3LogsPath=s3://<s3 bucket>/path --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID> 
```

You receive a validation messages like this
```sh
  #   ----------------------- 
  #   |PutPipelineDefinition|
  #   +-----------+---------+
  #   |  errored  |  False  |
  #   +-----------+---------+
```

Now activate the pipeline
```sh
  $> aws datapipeline activate-pipeline --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID>
```

Check the status of your pipeline 
```
  >$ aws datapipeline list-runs --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID>
```

You will receive status information on the pipeline.  
```sh
       Name                                                Scheduled Start      Status                 
       ID                                                  Started              Ended
